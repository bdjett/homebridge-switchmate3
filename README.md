# A Homebridge plugin for Switchmate3 #Switchmate is a BLE controlled light switch add-on that provide smart home capability to conventional light switches.This plugin is developed for a specific model of Switchmate switch TSM003W. This is the newer toggle style Switchmatewhich have a smaller form factor for fitting on a multi-gang switch.This plugin is a fork of [homebridge-switchmate](https://github.com/emmcc/homebridge-switchmate) a Homebridge Pluginfor the original Switchmate (RSM0001 & RSM0002). As the communication protocol of these two product is quite different.I have to use [node-switchmate3](https://github.com/valkjsaaa/node-switchmate3) as the communication library. Anyattempt to merge them would be welcome :)This plugin is still very experimental. Please create an issue or a pull request for any problem you encountered.
